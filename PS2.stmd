*I am trying out using markstat package for better reproducability, All code and asnwers will be in the same document, I will include the .stmd file and the boot file I use for running it (you will need to change the directories*

*Also, all files can be found on my github at https://github.com/MattarKlein/Econometrics-B.git*

## Import Data
```s
clear all
use "star_problem_set.dta"
```
## Question 1
#### (a) Run Regression Basic Regression

```s
quietly gen sc = .
quietly gen ra = .
foreach v in k 1 2 3{
quietly gen tss`v' = treadss`v' + tmathss`v'
quietly replace sc = cltype`v' == 1
quietly replace ra = cltype`v' == 3
quietly regress tss`v' sc ra, robust
quietly eststo a_reg_`v'
}
```
\newpage
```s
label variable tssk "Kindergarden"
label variable tss1 "1st Grade"
label variable tss2 "2st Grade"
label variable tss3 "3st Grade"
label variable sc "Small Class"
label variable ra "Regular + Ass"

esttab a_reg_k a_reg_1 a_reg_2 a_reg_3, label
//![Fuel Efficiency by Weight](test.pdf)
```
#### (b) Run Regression With Normalized Grades
```s
foreach v in k 1 2 3{
quietly summarize tss`v'
quietly gen tss`v'_normalized = (treadss`v' + tmathss`v')/r(sd)
quietly replace sc = cltype`v' == 1
quietly replace ra = cltype`v' == 3
quietly regress tss`v'_normalized sc ra, robust
quietly eststo b_reg_`v'
}
```

```s
label variable tssk_normalized "Kindergarden Norm"
label variable tss1_normalized "1st Grade Norm"
label variable tss2_normalized "2st Grade Norm"
label variable tss3_normalized "3st Grade Norm"
label variable sc "Small Class"
label variable ra "Regular + Ass"

esttab b_reg_k b_reg_1 b_reg_2 b_reg_3, label
```
